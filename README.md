# Ninjavote

Ninjavote is a web application for instantly creating simple polls in your group chats.

### Running locally

To install all dependencies and run both the server and the client locally, run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/mikkelsvartveit/ninjavote.git
cd ninjavote/frontend
npm run install:all
npm start
```

The Feathers server should now be running at `localhost:3030` and the Svelte app at `localhost:3000`.
